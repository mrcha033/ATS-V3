TRADING RISK DISCLAIMER:
========================

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

CRYPTOCURRENCY AND FINANCIAL TRADING INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF LOSS AND IS NOT 
SUITABLE FOR ALL INVESTORS. THE VALUATION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES AND FUTURES MAY 
FLUCTUATE, AND, AS A RESULT, CLIENTS MAY LOSE MORE THAN THEIR ORIGINAL INVESTMENT.

THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL AND GEOPOLITICAL EVENTS IS ALREADY FACTORED INTO MARKET 
PRICES. THE HIGHLY LEVERAGED NATURE OF FUTURES TRADING MEANS THAT SMALL MARKET 
MOVEMENTS WILL HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON YOUR TRADING ACCOUNT AND THIS CAN WORK 
AGAINST YOU, LEADING TO LARGE LOSSES OR CAN WORK FOR YOU, LEADING TO LARGE GAINS.

IF THE MARKET MOVES AGAINST YOU, YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS GREATER THAN THE 
AMOUNT YOU DEPOSITED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE RISKS 
AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES YOU USE AND FOR THE CHOSEN TRADING SYSTEM.

NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE 
PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE 
OF FUTURE RESULTS.

BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS 
DISCLAIMER AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.
